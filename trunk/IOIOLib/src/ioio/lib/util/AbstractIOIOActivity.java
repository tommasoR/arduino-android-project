/**
 * A convenience class for easy creation of IOIO-based applications.
 * 
 * It is used by creating a concrete Activity in your application, which extends
 * this class. This class then takes care of proper creation and abortion of the
 * IOIO connection and of a dedicated thread for IOIO communication.
 * 
 * In the intended usage the client should extend this class and implement
 * {@link #createIOIOThread()}, which should return an implementation of the
 * IOIOThread abstract class. In this implementation, the client implements the
 * {@link IOIOThread#setup()} method, which gets called as soon as communication
 * with the IOIO is established, and the {@link IOIOThread#loop()} method, which
 * gets called repetitively as long as the IOIO is connected. Both methods
 * should access the {@link IOIOThread#ioio_} field for controlling the IOIO.
